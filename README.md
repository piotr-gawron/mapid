# FastQ ID change

Type in the console:

```
java -cp build/jar/mapid.jar list.fastq.FastqNameChange inputDirectory outputDirectory partsForId prefix
```

* `inputDirectory` - directory with raw fastq files where ids should be changed
* `outputDirectory` - directory where output fastq files should be put *MUST be different then `inputDirectory`*
* `partsForId` - numeric value defining how many parts of the filename (separated by "_") should be used as part of the id
* `prefix` - optional prefix for fastq sequence name

Example:
 
```
java -cp build/jar/mapid.jar list.fastq.FastqNameChange testFiles out 6 ".;barcodelabel="
```
